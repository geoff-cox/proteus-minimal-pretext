  "body": " Proteus Chpt 9 Questions   Range of a sequence   Select all statements that correctly describe the of a sequence .      It is the set of all distinct values taken on by .    The range collects values the sequence hits, ignoring how many times a value repeats.      It is the ordered list .    The ordered list is the list of terms. The range is a set, so it ignores order and repetition.      If repeats values, those repeated values appear only once in the range.    Repetition does not create new elements of the range.      The range must be infinite because the sequence has infinitely many terms.    A sequence can take only finitely many distinct values (for example, alternating between two numbers).      The range can be finite even though the domain is infinite.    What matters is how many distinct outputs occur, not how many inputs there are.      Changing the order of the terms changes the range.    The range is a set of values, so order does not matter; reordering terms does not change which values occur.       Using the function–sequence limit link   Suppose you find a function with for all , but the limit does not exist. What can you conclude about ?      The sequence limit does not exist.    A non-existent limit for over the reals does not force the integer-input subsequence to behave the same way.      No definite conclusion: the sequence limit may exist or may not exist.    It is possible for to oscillate on real inputs while behaves more simply on integer inputs (for example, a cosine function can do this).      The sequence must diverge to .    Diverging to is a specific type of divergence; “no limit for ” does not imply unbounded growth of .      The sequence must converge, but you cannot find the value.    The theorem only gives implications in one direction: a limit for implies a limit for , not the other way around.       Which idea fits the sequence?   Match each sequence with the most appropriate conclusion or tool suggested by the narrative.    Different sequences call for different “first looks”: extending to a familiar function, checking for oscillation, using absolute values, or recognizing unbounded growth.      Extend to a rational function and use a limit at infinity to find the sequence limit.     Recognize that every term equals , so the sequence converges to .     Use oscillation to argue the terms get close to both and infinitely often, so no limit exists.     Use and conclude (Absolute Value Theorem idea).     Show that for every , terms eventually exceed , so the sequence diverges to .      Convergent vs. bounded   Which statement is always true?      Every bounded sequence converges.    A sequence can stay within bounds and still fail to settle to one value (oscillation is a common reason).      Every convergent sequence is bounded.    If the terms get arbitrarily close to a finite limit, then all but finitely many terms lie in a small interval around that limit, and the remaining finitely many terms can also be bounded.      Every divergent sequence is unbounded.    Divergence can happen even when the terms remain between two numbers (for instance, by oscillating without approaching a single value).      If a sequence is unbounded, then it must diverge to .    “Unbounded” allows growth toward , toward , or even behavior that escapes in both directions.      Sequence vocabulary   Match each term or notation to its meaning.    A sequence is a function on . The words “term,” “domain,” and “range” describe inputs, outputs, and how we talk about them.     Domain of a sequence  The set of inputs, namely the natural numbers .    Range of a sequence  The set of all distinct values that occur among .    Term  The value of the sequence at , i.e. .    Notation  The entire sequence (the list of terms produced by ).    Factorial  The product , with .     Limit language: informal to formal   Match each informal description to the precise statement or term it corresponds to.    Convergence is about what happens after some index . Divergence to is about eventually exceeding any threshold .      a distance away from  Given any    somewhere in the sequence  there exists an    the rest of the terms are within this distance of  such that for all      Bounded inequality   Arrange the blocks to form the inequality that expresses “ is bounded” using a lower bound and an upper bound .             Understanding Limits of Sequences   Which of the following best describes what it means for a sequence to have limit ?      Every term of the sequence equals .    This is too restrictive. A sequence can converge to even if no term actually equals , as long as the terms get arbitrarily close to .      The terms of the sequence get closer to , but never reach it.    This is close, but not quite right. The terms can actually equal sometimes—the key is that they eventually stay arbitrarily close to .      For any , all terms past some point will be closer to than .    Excellent! This captures the essence of the - definition:    Given any distance between and    there exists an some point    such that are closer to than    for all for all terms past some point         The average of all terms in the sequence equals .    This describes a different concept (Cesàro summation). Limits are about the eventual behavior of terms, not their average.        Connecting Function and Sequence Limits   Consider the function . If we know that , what can we conclude about the sequence ?      We cannot conclude anything about .    Actually, we can! Since for all positive integers , Theorem 8.1.2 allows us to draw a conclusion.       might equal 3, but we need more information.    We actually have enough information. Check Theorem 8.1.2 about the relationship between function limits and sequence limits.           Correct! By Theorem 8.1.2, if and , then . This theorem is extremely useful for evaluating sequence limits!      The sequence diverges.    No—since the corresponding function limit exists and equals 3, the sequence converges to 3 by Theorem 8.1.2.        Convergence and Divergence Properties   Which of the following statements are TRUE?      If does not exist, the sequence might still converge.    Correct! The example oscillates as a function, but converges to 1.      A sequence that oscillates between two values must diverge.    This is false. While the sequence from Example 8.1.4 does oscillate and diverge, a sequence could oscillate between values that get closer together and still converge (like converging to 0).      If , then .    Correct! This is the Absolute Value Theorem (Theorem 8.1.4). If the absolute values approach 0, then the terms themselves must approach 0.      Every convergent sequence must be monotonic.    This is false. The sequence converges to 0 but is not monotonic—it alternates between positive and negative values.      We can use L'Hôpital's Rule to evaluate some sequence limits.    Correct! When we can write for some function , we can use L'Hôpital's Rule on and then apply Theorem 8.1.2.        Identifying Bounded Sequences   Match each sequence to its boundedness property.    Remember: bounded means both bounded above and below; bounded above means there's a ceiling but possibly no floor; bounded below means there's a floor but possibly no ceiling.       Bounded     Bounded below only     Bounded above only     Unbounded       Bounded Sequences and Convergence   True or False: If a sequence is bounded, then it must converge.    False! Theorem 8.1.8 states that convergent sequences are bounded, but the converse is not true. A counterexample is , which is bounded (all terms are either 1 or -1) but diverges because it oscillates. To guarantee convergence, a bounded sequence must also be monotonic (Theorem 8.1.10).      Identifying Monotonic Behavior   Click on all sequences below that are monotonically increasing.             A sequence is monotonically increasing if for all . Check this by computing : if it's always non-negative, the sequence is increasing. Note that alternates in sign, increases then decreases (see Example 8.1.7c), and is decreasing since the term grows.      Applying the Monotonic Convergence Theorem   Consider the sequence where and for all . Suppose we can show that:  (i) for all , and  (ii) for all .  What can we conclude?      The sequence might converge or might diverge—we need more information.    We actually have enough information! We know the sequence is both monotonic (increasing) and bounded (above by 3, below by 2).      The sequence must converge to some limit where .    Excellent! By Theorem 8.1.10, a monotonically increasing sequence that is bounded above must converge. Since all terms satisfy , the limit must satisfy . (In fact, by taking limits in the recursion relation, we can show !)      The sequence must converge to 3.    While the theorem guarantees convergence, it doesn't tell us the exact value of the limit. We know the limit is at most 3, but it could be less.      The sequence must diverge to infinity.    No—the sequence is bounded above by 3, so it cannot diverge to infinity. Check Theorem 8.1.10 about bounded monotonic sequences.      "

The range is a set, so it ignores order and repetition.      If repeats values, those repeated values appear only once in the range.    Repetition does not create new elements of the range.      The range must be infinite because the sequence has infinitely many terms.    A sequence can take only finitely many distinct values (for example, alternating between two numbers).      The range can be finite even though the domain is infinite.    What matters is how many distinct outputs occur, not how many inputs there are.      Changing the order of the terms changes the range.    The range is a set of values, so order does not matter; reordering terms does not change which values occur.     "

A sequence can stay within bounds and still fail to settle to one value (oscillation is a common reason).      Every convergent sequence is bounded.    If the terms get arbitrarily close to a finite limit, then all but finitely many terms lie in a small interval around that limit, and the remaining finitely many terms can also be bounded.      Every divergent sequence is unbounded.    Divergence can happen even when the terms remain between two numbers (for instance, by oscillating without approaching a single value).
