        <statement><p>When computing <m>f(x_0)</m> in the formula, you get a value near zero.</p></statement>

        <statement><p>The value of <m>x_1</m> is very close to <m>x_0</m>.</p></statement>

  <title>PROTEUS EXERCISE</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      There are two methods used by police to enforce speed limits on highways:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Radar, in which an officer uses a roadside radar gun to measure the speed of a vehicle
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Aircraft patrol, which uses regularly-spaced markings on the highway,
            and measurement from an aircraft of the time it takes a vehicle to travel between markings.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Explain, using the [REF] how these two methods are related.
      In particular, if aircraft patrol can only measure average speed,
      how can an officer be certain that a driver was speeding?
